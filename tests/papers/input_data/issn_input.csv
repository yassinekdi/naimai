0,Marketable Yield of Potato and Its Quantitative Parameters after Application of Herbicides and Biostimulants,"K. Zarzecka, M. Gugała, A. Sikorska, K. Grzywacz, M. Niewęgłowski",2020,Biology,"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is grown in over 160 countries. Weed competition and environmental stressors during the vegetative growth stage significantly impact crop yields. An experiment was conducted from 2012 to 2014 in Poland to assess the effect of herbicides linuron + clomazone (L+CH) and metribuzin (M) as well as herbicides mixed with biostimulants (linuron + clomazone and algae extract of Ecklonia maxima—auxins and gibberellins (L+CH+E) and metribuzin + sodium p-nitrophenolate, sodium o-nitrophenolate and sodium 5-nitroguaiacolate (M+S)) on weed infestation, marketable yield and yield components of the following three table potato cultivars: Bartek, Gawin and Honorata. In plots where potato had been treated with herbicides and herbicides mixed with biostimulants, a decline in the fresh matter of weeds was observed, ranging from 72.4% to 96.1%, which was followed by an increase in potato marketable yield (from 27.5% to 61%) and improved parameters of S. tuberosum yield components, compared with the control. Linear correlation coefficients indicated that the following characteristics: marketable yield, weight of tubers per plant and average weight per tuber were associated with weed infestation determined prior to potato harvest.",10.3390/agriculture10020049,7.0,34.0,Agriculture
1,Pseudomonas putida Isolation and Quantification by Real-Time PCR in Agricultural Soil Biodegradable Mulching,"Stefania Fontanazza, A. Restuccia, G. Mauromicale, A. Scavo, C. Abbate",2021,Environmental Science,"To reduce the plastic waste problem in agriculture, biodegradable plastic (BP) mulch films have become of key importance thanks to their biodegradability and beneficial effects on crops. However, at present, BPs cannot always replace conventional plastics, because biodegradation is governed by many biotic and abiotic factors under field conditions. This research aimed at isolating and identifying, from soil particles directly attached to the surface of BP samples, the microorganisms responsible of degradation through a combined approach based on biodegradation and molecular tests. For this purpose, a field trial within a Mediterranean apricot orchard was carried out to study the biodegradation of a commercial BP mulch with respect to a no-BP, a conventional apricot management, following the standard agricultural practices, and a subterranean clover cover cropping, either incorporating or leaving its dead mulches on the soil surface. After BP film appeared visibly degraded in field, we isolated from soil particles attached to the polymer surface, a mesophilic bacterium with certain degradative potential assessed by plate and liquid assays, identified by sequencing as Pseudomonas putida. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed the P. putida was significantly more abundant in PB plots than the other plot treatments. These preliminary results are potentially applicable to accelerate the degradation of BP mulch films and decrease the plastic pollution in agriculture.",10.3390/agriculture11080782,,30.0,Agriculture
2,"Influence of Cover Crop, Tillage, and Crop Rotation Management on Soil Nutrients","Samuel I. Haruna, N. Nkongolo",2020,Environmental Science,"Cover cropping, tillage and crop rotation management can influence soil nutrient availability and crop yield through changes in soil physical, chemical and biological processes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of three years of cover crop, tillage, and crop rotation on selected soil nutrients. Twenty-four plots each of corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) were established on a 4.05 ha field and arranged in a three-factor factorial design. The three factors (treatments) were two methods of tillage (no-tillage (NT) vs. moldboard plow [conventional] tillage (CT)), two types of cover crop (no cover crop (NC) vs. cover crop (CC)) and four typess of rotation (continuous corn, continuous soybean, corn/soybean and soybean/corn). Soil samples were taken each year at four different depths in each plot; 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–40 cm and 40–60 cm, and analyzed for soil nutrients: calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), nitrogen (NO3 and NH4), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu). The results in the first year showed that CT increased NO3-N availability by 40% compared with NT. In the second year, NH4-N was 8% lower under CC compared with NC management. In the third year, P was 12% greater under CC management compared with NC management. Thus, CC can enhance crop production systems by increasing P availability and scavenging excess NH4-N from the soil, but longer-term studies are needed to evaluate long-term effects.",10.3390/agriculture10060225,5.0,46.0,Agriculture

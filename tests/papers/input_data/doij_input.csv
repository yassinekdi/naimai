0,Mathematical Modelling of the Relationship between Two Different Temperament Classifications: During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"M. Rasheed, Murtaza Mohiuddin Junaid Farooque, H. Acharya, Mohammed Sharique A. Quadri",2021,"['Technology: Technology (General)', 'Social Sciences: Social sciences (General)']","In medicine, it is well known that healthy individuals have different physical and mental characteristics. Ancient Indian medicine, Ayurveda and the Persian-Arabic traditional Unani medicine has two distinct approaches for the classification of human subjects according to their temperaments. The individual temperament is an important foundation for personalized medicine, which can help in the prevention and treatment of many diseases including COVID-19. This paper attempts to explore the relationship of the utmost important concepts of these systems called individual temperament named as Prakruti in Ayurveda and Mizaj in Unani practice using mathematical modelling. The results of mathematical modelling can be adopted expediently for the development of algorithms that can be applied in medical informatics. For this, a significant literature review has been carried out. Based on the previous researchers' reviews the essential parameters have been identified for making the relationship and hypothesis were framed. The mathematical modelling was adopted to propose the existence of the relationship between the parameters of such an ancient and rich medicine systems. The hypotheses are validated through the mathematic driven model. Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-01258 Full Text: PDF",10.28991/esj-2021-01258,4.0,Emerging Science Journal
1,Mapping Global Research Output in Big Data during 2007-16,"S. Dhawan, B. Gupta, Ritu Gupta",2018,"['Technology: Technology (General)', 'Social Sciences: Social sciences (General)']","The paper examines global research in big data, as covered in Scopus database 2007-16, on a series of bibliometric indicators. The study finds that big data registered exceedingly fast growth (135.2%), but averaged low citation impact per paper (3.75) and accounted for very low share of highly cited papers (0.86%) in 10 years. The study reports publication trends in big data research by top countries, top institutions, top authors, top journals, major subject areas, publication modes, and country-level share of international collaborative publications. The study concludes that big data is a subject of recent origin. Given its major potential to impact business, governance, society, healthcare, industry and many other sectors, big data is fast emerging as a major discipline of interest and importance to nations, corporates, and institutions across developed and fast emerging economies.",10.28991/esj-2018-01135,1.0,Emerging Science Journal
2,Exploring Existence of Host-Guest Inclusion Complex of β-Cyclodextrin of a Biologically Active Compound with the Manifestation of Diverse Interactions,"H. Rahaman, Niloy Roy, Aditi Roy, Samapika Ray, M. Roy",2018,"['Technology: Technology (General)', 'Social Sciences: Social sciences (General)']","The host–guest interaction of p-nitro benzaldehyde as guest β-Cyclodextrins have been investigated which have significant applications in the field of medicine such as controlled drug delivery. The 1H NMR study confirms the formation of inclusion complex while surface tension and conductivity studies support the formation inclusion complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. The stoichiometry of the inclusion complex was also supported with Job’s plot method by UV-Visible spectroscopy. FT-IR spectra and SEM study also support the inclusion process. Association constants of  the inclusion complexes have  been  calculated using  the  Benesi–Hildebrand  method,  while  the  thermodynamic  parameters  have  been  estimated  with  the help  of  van’t  Hoff  equation.",10.28991/esj-2018-01149,6.0,Emerging Science Journal
